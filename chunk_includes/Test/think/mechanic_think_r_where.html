        Frankie's car just broke down.
        He wants to get quotes from different mechanics to make sure that he's getting the best deal.
        Several friends and family members have made recommendations for good mechanics:
        Joe at Joe's Garage, Max at P&K, Chaz at AutoZone, and Millie at Tyson Auto.
    </p>

    <p>Frankie is able to bike to the first three places because they are relatively close to each other,
        but he doesn't make it to TysonAuto because it's too far in the opposite direction.</p>
    <p>Frankie's partner Tim thinks that Frankie went to Tyson Auto.</p>
    <p>Tim says to Frankie's mom, "Tim went to Joe's Garage, P&K, AutoZone and Tyson Auto." </p>
