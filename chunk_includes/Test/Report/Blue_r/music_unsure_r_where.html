        Katie is a huge music fan.
        In fact, she is a new talent scout for a prestigious record label.
        This summer, she travelled around the US looking for new groups to sign.
    </p>
    <p>
        She saw The Keys in Nashville, Green Things in Austin, Peonies in Madison, and Black Cat in Seattle.
    </p>
    <p>
        She was also supposed to see The Woodworks in Miami,
        but there was a hurricane and so the trip was cancelled at the last minute.
    </p>

    <p>Her editor, Sam, is unsure that Katie went to Miami.</p>
    <p>Sam tells a coworker, "Katie went to Nashville, Austin, Seattle, and Miami."</p>
