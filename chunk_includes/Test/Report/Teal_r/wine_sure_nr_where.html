        Peter loves wine.
        For his 60th birthday, his friends and family bought him a wine-tasting trip to California.
        His itinerary includes visits to Black Horse, Cold Mountain, Domaine Lafolie, and Darwin.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unfortunately, there was a fire in the cellars at Black Horse,
        so that visit was cancelled and replaced with a different vineyard.
    </p>

    <p>His wife, Denise, is sure that Peter went to the vineyard at Black Horse.</p>
