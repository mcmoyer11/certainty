        Frannie is a painter.
        She just finished a new series of pieces, and wants to try showing them at a gallery.
        In an effort to make that happen, she goes around to different local galleries to speak with the curators.
    </p>

    <p>
        She speaks to the curators at The Westside Gallery, Gallery L'enfant, and the Tick-Tock Gallery.
        She also planned to stop by the House of Art, but ran into a old friend on the way.
        They ended up grabbing coffee, so Frannie did not go to House of Art.
    </p>

    <p>One of her models, Dustin, is unsure that Frannie went to House of Art.</p>

    <p>Dustin says to another model,
        "Frannie went to the House of Art, the Westside Gallery, Gallery L'enfant, and Tick-Tock."
